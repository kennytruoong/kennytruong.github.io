<h2> Biography: My name is Kenny Truong, and I am currently an undergraduate at California State University, Long Beach. My major is Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. However, I want to build my career as a Software Engineer once I graduate, so I made this website. I hope to complete more projects and post all of them on here in the future </h2>
